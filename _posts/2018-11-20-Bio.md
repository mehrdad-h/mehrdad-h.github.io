I entered PhD program of Computer Science at University of Manitoba in Jan. 2017. Since then I’ve been doing my research on Computer Vision and Deep Learning under supervision of [Dr. Yang Wang](http://cs.umanitoba.ca/~ywang "Dr. Yang Wang"). Before Joing CS@UofM, I had the chance to be supervised by [Dr. Mahdi Eftekhari](http://academicstaff.uk.ac.ir/en/eftekhari "Dr. Mahdi Eftekhari") in my Master’s program at Shahid Bahonar University of Kerman, Iran. During my Master's, I focused on classification of imabalanced datasets using fuzzy- and ensemble-based techniques. I finished my Bachelor's program at University of Birjand, Iran.

My primary research lies on the intersection of Image/Video understanding and NLP using Deep Learning.
