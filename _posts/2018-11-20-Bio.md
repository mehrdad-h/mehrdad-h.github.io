I entered PhD program of Computer Science at University of Manitoba in Jan. 2017. Since then I'm doing my research on Computer Vision and Deep Learning under supervision of Dr. Yang Wang. Before Joing CS@UofM, I had the chance to be supervised by Dr. Mahdi Enftekhari in my Master's program at Shahid Bahonar University of Kerman, Iran. My primary research lies on the intersection of Image/Video understanding and NLP.
